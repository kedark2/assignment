# Assessing Keerthana's GIT submission

I think Keerthana has done her assignment quite well. 
She has tried to include all the commands. Not only that, she also included additional command not mentioned tutorial file. It took a while for me to figure out the sequence but yeah I figured out after reviewing couple of times.

The diffrence in our assignment in my opinion is that I tried to do everything in sequence due to which I might have missed to use some commands but she has tried to include more commands than me.

## Commands that were not in tutorial file

Below are the commands that were not in tutorial file was 
#### show
```sh
$ git show HEAD
```
"git show" command shows different objects. Here she has tried to show the HEAD.

### difftool
"git difftool" is a Git command that allows us to compare and edit files between revisions using common diff tools
```sh
$ git difftool
```
